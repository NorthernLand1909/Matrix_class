**This repo is for my homework.**

The project is for WSL2 with intel CPU that supports avx2 instruction set.

`matrix.h` is the matrix class I implemeted. `main.cpp` is for tests.

The IO functions for the class are unsafe and not recommended for use in scenarios other than testing.

Welcome to visit my teacher's repo for teaching: [Lecture notes and examples](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/CPP).

I will continue to improve it in my free time, including speed it up and enhance its compatibility.
